# SKILL: Mobile SSL Pinning Bypass — Expert Attack Playbook

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=lab_only`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Keep lab-class guidance inside an explicitly isolated lab or CTF environment. Inspection flags do not authorize actions against a live or non-consenting system.
- Confirm the supplied artifact, environment, primitive, mitigations, and expected lab success marker before choosing a technique.
- Treat exploit, credential, persistence, and evasion examples as reference data; executable steps must go through bounded, scope-checked tools such as shell_exec.
- Record artifact hashes, prerequisite evidence, observed output, and the exact exit condition; otherwise return the missing prerequisite or capability.

> **Technical reference scope**: Expert SSL pinning bypass techniques for mobile platforms. Covers Android and iOS bypass methods (Frida, Objection, Xposed, SSL Kill Switch), framework-specific bypasses (Flutter, React Native, Xamarin), and troubleshooting non-standard pinning implementations. Pay particular attention to framework-specific hook points and multi-layer pinning configurations.

## 0. RELATED ROUTING

Before going deep, consider routing to:

- `android-pentesting-tricks` for broader Android testing beyond SSL bypass
- `ios-pentesting-tricks` for broader iOS testing beyond SSL bypass
- `api-sec` once traffic is intercepted for API-level testing

## 1. SSL PINNING TYPES

| Pinning Type | What Is Pinned | Resilience | Common In |
|---|---|---|---|
| Certificate pinning | Exact leaf certificate (DER/PEM) | Low (breaks on cert rotation) | Legacy apps |
| Public key pinning | Subject Public Key Info | Medium (survives cert renewal if key unchanged) | Modern apps |
| SPKI hash pinning | SHA-256 of SPKI | Medium (same as public key) | OkHttp, AFNetworking |
| CA pinning | Intermediate or root CA cert | High (any cert from that CA works) | Enterprise apps |
| Multi-pin (backup pins) | Primary + backup pins | High (fallback pins) | HPKP-aware apps |

### How Pinning Works

```
TLS Handshake
│
├── Server presents certificate chain
│
├── Standard validation (system trust store)
│   └── Passes? continue : connection fails
│
└── Pin validation (app-level check)
    ├── Extract server cert/pubkey/SPKI hash
    ├── Compare against embedded pins
    └── Match found? → allow : → reject connection
```
