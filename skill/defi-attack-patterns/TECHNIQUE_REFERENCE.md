## 3. MEV (MAXIMAL EXTRACTABLE VALUE)

### 3.1 Sandwich Attack

```
Mempool observation: victim submits swap TOKEN_A → TOKEN_B with slippage 1%

Front-run:  Buy TOKEN_B (increase price)
Victim tx:  Swap executes at worse price (within slippage tolerance)
Back-run:   Sell TOKEN_B (profit from price impact)

Profit = victim's price impact - gas costs × 2
```

### 3.2 JIT (Just-In-Time) Liquidity

```
1. Observe large pending swap in mempool
2. Provide concentrated liquidity in the exact price range (Uniswap V3 tick)
3. Victim's swap executes → JIT LP earns majority of fees
4. Remove liquidity immediately after swap
5. Profit = fee earned - gas - impermanent loss (minimal for single block)
```

### 3.3 Liquidation MEV

```
1. Monitor lending protocols for positions approaching liquidation threshold
2. When price oracle updates → position becomes liquidatable
3. Front-run other liquidators → execute liquidation
4. Receive liquidation bonus (typically 5-15% of collateral)
5. Sell collateral for profit
```

### 3.4 MEV Protection Mechanisms

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|---|---|
| Flashbots Protect | Sends tx to private mempool; only block builder sees it |
| MEV Blocker | RPC endpoint that routes through MEV-aware relayers |
| Cow Protocol (batch auction) | Batch matching eliminates ordering advantage |
| Encrypted mempools | Threshold encryption; decrypt only at block build time |
| MEV-Share | User captures portion of MEV extracted from their tx |

## 4. PRECISION LOSS EXPLOITATION

### 4.1 Rounding Errors in Token Calculations

Solidity has no floating point. Integer division truncates:

```
shares = depositAmount * totalShares / totalAssets
```

If `totalAssets` is very large relative to `depositAmount * totalShares`, result rounds to 0 → depositor gets no shares but pool keeps the deposit.

### 4.2 First Depositor / Vault Inflation Attack

```
1. Attacker deposits 1 wei → receives 1 share
2. Attacker donates 1,000,000 tokens directly to vault (not via deposit)
3. Vault state: 1,000,001 tokens, 1 share
4. Victim deposits 999,999 tokens:
   shares = 999,999 * 1 / 1,000,001 = 0 (integer truncation)
5. Victim gets 0 shares; attacker owns 100% of vault (now 2,000,000 tokens)
6. Attacker withdraws all
```

**Defenses:**
- Mint dead shares on first deposit (OpenZeppelin ERC4626 offset)
- Require minimum initial deposit
- Internal accounting with virtual offset

### 4.3 Dust Attack via Precision Truncation

Repeated small operations where each truncation loses 1 wei. Accumulate across thousands of operations → material loss.

## 5. GOVERNANCE ATTACKS

### 5.1 Flash Loan Governance

Borrow governance tokens → vote → return. Only works if protocol doesn't snapshot balances before voting.

### 5.2 Timelock Bypass

| Vector | Method |
|---|---|
| Timelock set to 0 | Admin can execute proposals instantly |
| `emergencyExecute` function | Bypasses timelock for "emergencies" |
| Guardian/multisig override | Single point of failure |
| Proposal cancellation by attacker | Front-run with cancel if threshold met |

### 5.3 Quorum Manipulation

```
Protocol requires 10% quorum (10M tokens out of 100M supply)
├── Flash borrow 10M governance tokens
├── Create proposal: set admin = attacker
├── Vote with borrowed tokens → meets quorum
├── If no timelock: execute immediately
└── Return tokens
```

---

## 6. BRIDGE EXPLOITS

### 6.1 Common Bridge Attack Vectors

| Vector | Example |
|---|---|
| Signature verification bypass | Ronin Bridge ($624M) — compromised 5/9 validators |
| Message replay | Replay deposit proof on multiple chains |
| Fake deposit proof | Submit proof for non-existent L1 deposit |
| Validator collusion | Compromised majority of bridge validators |
| Smart contract bug | Wormhole ($320M) — uninitialized guardian set |
| Upgradeable proxy exploit | Attacker gains upgrade authority → swap implementation |

### 6.2 Cross-Chain Message Verification

```
Secure pattern:
├── Source chain: emit event with (destination, amount, nonce, chainId)
├── Relayer: submit proof (Merkle proof of event inclusion)
├── Destination chain: verify proof against known source block header
│   ├── Check nonce not replayed
│   ├── Check chainId matches
│   ├── Verify Merkle proof against trusted root
│   └── Mint/release tokens

Vulnerable pattern:
├── Relayer: submit (destination, amount) signed by N-of-M validators
└── If M is small or keys are compromised → forge signatures
```

## 7. TOKEN STANDARD EDGE CASES

### 7.1 ERC-20 Approval Front-Running

```
1. Alice approves Bob for 100 tokens
2. Alice wants to change approval to 50 tokens
3. Bob sees the approval change tx in mempool
4. Bob front-runs: transferFrom(Alice, Bob, 100) — uses old approval
5. Alice's approval change executes: approval = 50
6. Bob calls transferFrom(Alice, Bob, 50) — uses new approval
7. Bob extracted 150 tokens instead of 50
```

Defense: `approve(0)` first, then `approve(newAmount)`. Or use `increaseAllowance/decreaseAllowance`.

### 7.2 ERC-777 Reentrancy via Hooks

ERC-777 tokens call `tokensReceived()` hook on the recipient before completing the transfer → classic reentrancy vector.

```
transfer(attacker, amount)
├── _beforeTokenTransfer hook
├── Balance update
├── tokensReceived() callback to recipient  ← reentrancy window
│   └── attacker re-enters: transfer, swap, deposit, etc.
└── _afterTokenTransfer hook
```

### 7.3 Fee-on-Transfer Tokens

Tokens that deduct a fee on each transfer. Protocol receives less than `amount`:

```solidity
// Vulnerable: assumes received == amount
token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
deposits[msg.sender] += amount; // overcredits by fee amount

// Fixed: measure actual balance change
uint before = token.balanceOf(address(this));
token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint received = token.balanceOf(address(this)) - before;
deposits[msg.sender] += received;
```

### 7.4 Rebasing Tokens

Tokens that automatically adjust balances (e.g., Aave aTokens, stETH). Protocols holding rebasing tokens may have accounting mismatches if they cache balances.
