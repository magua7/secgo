# SKILL: Race Conditions — Testing & Exploitation Playbook

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=active`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Restrict activity to the exact TaskSpec scope. Use only bounded registry actions accepted by execution policy; exploitation work is limited to the operator's authorized, evidence-recorded scope.
- Preserve baseline and test ToolResults as Evidence, including errors and negative observations, before drawing a conclusion.
- Treat command examples as reference syntax; actual execution goes through the bounded shell_exec tool when the operator has authorized it.
- Complete only after every success criterion is assessed from cited evidence.
<!-- zhiyugo:contract:end -->

> **Technical reference scope**: Treat race conditions as **authorization/state integrity** issues: non-atomic read-then-write lets multiple requests observe stale state. Prioritize **one-time** or **balance-like** operations. Combine **parallel transport** (HTTP/1.1 last-byte sync, HTTP/2 single-packet, Turbo Intruder gates) with **application evidence** (duplicate success responses, inconsistent balances, duplicate ledger rows). **Authorized testing only.** Routing note: for business workflows, coupons, inventory, or one-time rewards, start with this skill and route to `business-logic-vulnerabilities`.

## 0. QUICK START — What to Test First

Target endpoints where **check** and **update** are unlikely to be a single atomic database operation:

| Priority | Operation class | Example paths / parameters |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | One-time redeem / coupon / bonus | `redeem`, `apply_coupon`, `claim_reward`, `voucher` |
| 2 | Balance / quota / stock deduction | `transfer`, `purchase`, `reserve`, `inventory` |
| 3 | Invite / referral / signup bonus | `invite_accept`, `referral_claim` |
| 4 | Password / email / MFA verification | `verify_token`, `confirm_email`, `reset_password` |
| 5 | Idempotent-looking APIs without strong keys | `POST` that should succeed only once per user |

**Evidence prerequisites**:

1. Preserve the supplied baseline and final state.
2. Require an external harness's timestamped batch and all responses.
3. Cite each duplicate success or inconsistency.

ZhiyuGo cannot capture or send concurrent requests.

## 1. CORE CONCEPT

### 1.1 TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use)

```
Thread A                    Thread B
   |                            |
   +-- CHECK (resource OK)      |
   |                            +-- CHECK (resource OK)  ← both see "OK"
   +-- USE / UPDATE             |
   |                            +-- USE / UPDATE           ← duplicate effect
```

**TOCTOU** means the **decision** (check) and the **mutation** (use) are not one indivisible step.

### 1.2 Non-atomic read-then-write

Typical vulnerable pseudo-flow:

```text
balance = SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = ?
if balance >= amount:
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?
```

Two concurrent requests can both pass the `if` before either `UPDATE` commits.

### 1.3 Database-level vs application-level locking gaps

| Layer | What goes wrong |
|-------|------------------|
| **Application** | In-memory flag, cache, or session says "not used yet" while DB already updated — or the reverse. |
| **ORM / service** | Two instances, no distributed lock; each thinks it owns the decision. |
| **DB** | Missing `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, wrong isolation level, or logic split across multiple statements without transaction. |
| **API gateway** | Per-IP rate limit is **check-then-increment** — parallel burst passes duplicate checks. |

**Hint**: `UNIQUE` constraints and **idempotency keys** often eliminate entire bug classes — test whether the app **enforces** them on the hot path.

---

## 2. ATTACK PATTERNS

### 2.1 Limit-overrun (double redeem / double claim)

Require supplied parallel-request evidence; ZhiyuGo cannot send the batch:

```http
POST /api/v1/rewards/claim HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"reward_id":"welcome_bonus"}
```

**Success signal**: HTTP `200`/`201` more than once, duplicate ledger entries, or balance higher than policy allows.

### 2.2 Rate-limit bypass via simultaneity

If limits are implemented as **counters checked per request** without atomic increment:

```http
POST /api/v1/login HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Content-Type: application/json

{"email":"victim@example.com","password":"wrong"}
```

Fire **N** parallel attempts in one wave; compare with **N** sequential attempts.

**Success signal**: more failures accepted than documented cap, or lockout never triggers when burst completes inside one window.

### 2.3 Multi-step exploitation (beat the pipeline)

Workflow: `create → pay → confirm`. If **confirm** does not cryptographically bind to **pay** completion:

1. Require supplied traces for two authorized pipelines.
2. Check whether confirmation preceded matching payment; generation is unavailable.

**Success signal**: item marked paid/shipped without matching payment, or state skips backward.

---

## 3. HTTP/1.1 LAST-BYTE SYNCHRONIZATION

**Idea**: Hold all requests **blocked** until every socket has sent the full request **except the last byte** of the body; then release the final byte together so the server receives them in a tight cluster.

```text
Client 1: [headers + body - 1 byte] ----hold----+
Client 2: [headers + body - 1 byte] ----hold----+--> flush last byte together
Client N: [headers + body - 1 byte] ----hold----+
```

**Why**: Reduces **network jitter** between copies compared to naive sequential paste in Repeater.

**Capability gap**: Burp/Turbo Intruder and concurrency harnesses are external. Require supplied timestamped evidence; ZhiyuGo cannot run this test.
