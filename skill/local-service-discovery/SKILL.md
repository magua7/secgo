# Local service discovery

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=active`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Restrict activity to the exact TaskSpec scope. Use only bounded registry actions accepted by execution policy; exploitation work is limited to the operator's authorized, evidence-recorded scope.
- Preserve baseline and test ToolResults as Evidence, including errors and negative observations, before drawing a conclusion.
- Treat command examples as reference syntax; actual execution goes through the bounded shell_exec tool when the operator has authorized it.
- Complete only after every success criterion is assessed from cited evidence.
<!-- zhiyugo:contract:end -->

1. Confirm the exact host/IP and port set are present in the task scope and
   inputs. An objective mentioning a host is not authorization by itself.
2. Request the `network.scan` capability with a bounded list of TCP ports.
3. Preserve the complete tool result as evidence and record which scanner
   engine produced it.
4. Create an informational finding only when the structured result identifies
   at least one open port. Do not invent service versions or vulnerabilities.
5. Treat an empty open-port list as a valid negative result when the action
   succeeded. Treat unavailable/timeout/policy errors as failures, not as a
   clean scan.
6. Completion requires a successful action, intact evidence, and explicit
   coverage of the plan criterion.
