# SKILL: OAuth and OIDC Misconfiguration — Redirects, PKCE, Scopes, and Token Binding

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=active`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Restrict activity to the exact TaskSpec scope. Use only bounded registry actions accepted by execution policy; exploitation work is limited to the operator's authorized, evidence-recorded scope.
- Preserve baseline and test ToolResults as Evidence, including errors and negative observations, before drawing a conclusion.
- Treat command examples as reference syntax; actual execution goes through the bounded shell_exec tool when the operator has authorized it.
- Complete only after every success criterion is assessed from cited evidence.

> **Technical reference scope**: Use this skill when the target uses OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect and you need a focused misconfiguration checklist: redirect URI validation, state and nonce handling, PKCE enforcement, token audience, and account binding mistakes.

## 1. WHEN THIS SKILL APPLIES
Use this workflow when:
- The app supports `Login with Google`, GitHub, Microsoft, Okta, or other IdPs
- You see `authorize`, `callback`, `redirect_uri`, `code`, `state`, `nonce`, or `code_challenge`
- Mobile or SPA clients rely on OAuth or OIDC flows

For token cryptography and JWT header abuse, route to:
- `jwt-oauth-token-attacks`

## 2. HIGH-VALUE MISCONFIGURATION CHECKS

| Theme | What to Check |
|---|---|
| `state` handling | missing, static, predictable, or not bound to user session |
| `redirect_uri` validation | prefix match, open redirect chaining, path confusion, localhost leftovers |
| PKCE | missing for public clients, code verifier not enforced, downgraded flow |
| OIDC `nonce` | missing or not validated on ID token return |
| token audience and issuer | weak `aud` / `iss` checks, cross-client token reuse |
| account binding | callback binds attacker identity to victim session |
| scope handling | broader scopes granted than the user or client should receive |

## 3. QUICK TRIAGE

1. Map the full flow: authorize, callback, token exchange, logout.
2. Replay callback flows with altered `state`, `nonce`, and `redirect_uri`.
3. Compare SPA, mobile, and web clients for weaker validation.
4. Check whether one provider account can be rebound to another local account.
