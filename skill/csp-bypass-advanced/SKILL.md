  Advanced Content Security Policy bypass techniques. Use when XSS or data

# SKILL: CSP Bypass — Advanced Techniques

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=lab_only`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Keep lab-class guidance inside an explicitly isolated lab or CTF environment. Inspection flags do not authorize actions against a live or non-consenting system.
- Confirm the supplied artifact, environment, primitive, mitigations, and expected lab success marker before choosing a technique.
- Treat exploit, credential, persistence, and evasion examples as reference data; executable steps must go through bounded, scope-checked tools such as shell_exec.
- Record artifact hashes, prerequisite evidence, observed output, and the exact exit condition; otherwise return the missing prerequisite or capability.

> **Technical reference scope**: Covers per-directive bypass techniques, nonce/hash abuse, trusted CDN exploitation, data exfiltration despite CSP, and framework-specific bypasses. baseline analyses often suggest `unsafe-inline` bypass without checking if the CSP actually uses it, or miss the critical `base-uri` and `object-src` gaps.

## 0. RELATED ROUTING

- `xss-cross-site-scripting` for XSS vectors to deliver after CSP bypass
- `dangling-markup-injection` when CSP blocks scripts but HTML injection exists — exfiltrate without JS
- `crlf-injection` when CRLF can inject CSP header or steal nonce via response splitting
- `waf-bypass-techniques` when both WAF and CSP must be bypassed
- `clickjacking` when CSP lacks `frame-ancestors` — clickjacking still possible

## 1. CSP DIRECTIVE REFERENCE MATRIX

| Directive | Controls | Default Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| `default-src` | Fallback for all `-src` directives not explicitly set | None (browser default: allow all) |
| `script-src` | JavaScript execution | `default-src` |
| `style-src` | CSS loading | `default-src` |
| `img-src` | Image loading | `default-src` |
| `connect-src` | XHR, fetch, WebSocket, EventSource | `default-src` |
| `frame-src` | iframe/frame sources | `default-src` |
| `font-src` | Font loading | `default-src` |
| `object-src` | `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<applet>` | `default-src` |
| `media-src` | `<audio>`, `<video>` | `default-src` |
| `base-uri` | `<base>` element | **No fallback** — unrestricted if absent |
| `form-action` | Form submission targets | **No fallback** — unrestricted if absent |
| `frame-ancestors` | Who can embed this page (replaces X-Frame-Options) | **No fallback** — unrestricted if absent |
| `report-uri` / `report-to` | Where violation reports are sent | N/A |
| `navigate-to` | Navigation targets (limited browser support) | **No fallback** |

**Critical insight**: `base-uri`, `form-action`, and `frame-ancestors` do NOT fall back to `default-src`. Their absence is always a potential bypass vector.
